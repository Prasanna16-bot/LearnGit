I have installed Git GUI and I can use Git Bash or to cmd for executing commads
I have created a Repository(Repo) using command git init command
mkdir reponame - make directory
cd reponame - change directory 
dir - directory
ls - list out 
git init -b main/master - to create repo in local 
git init - to initialize a git repository in the current directory
git add . - to keep all the files in the current directory
git commit -m "Comment" - to commit all the files
git remote add origin <repo url> - link the local repo to remote repo
git push -u origin master - now your local repo is created, committed and linked to remote repository
